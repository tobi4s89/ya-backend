## Project information

#### Frameworks

For this project I opted for a laravel back-end, and a VueJS front-end application. I made this choice because I already have some knowledge of both, which means that they can be realized quickly.

#### Algorithm

The algorithm behind this concept is designed to systematically match a requesting user with an offered user. Think of a recruitment and / or dating platform.

#### Back-end data

Data that is saved in a database are properties, users, and a pivot table to connect both of them using one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

#### Front-end data

As a user you have the option to save reports of the matches they have requested. I chose this method because it is only relevant data for the user himself.
